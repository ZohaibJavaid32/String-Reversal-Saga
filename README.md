#Heading 1String Reversal Saga
Description
String Reversal Saga is a simple web application that allows users to add strings, apply string manipulation 
algorithms (reverse string and find longest substring), and search for previously added strings.

Features
- Add String: Users can enter a string into the "Add String" field and add it to the list.
- String Manipulation: Upon adding a string, the application automatically applies two algorithms:
   - Reverse String: The entered string is reversed.
   - Find Longest Substring: The longest substring without repeating characters is found.
- Display Results: The results (original string, reversed string, and longest substring) are displayed in a table below the input fields.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for previously added strings by entering a search term and clicking the "Search" button. If a match is found, the table is cleared and only the matching record is displayed.
